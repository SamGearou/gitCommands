# Some git Commands:
git add filename,
git commit -m "what your commit will say",
git push (dont need to specify, because the repo was cloned),
git status,
git log,
git config --list (lists all the settings git can find),
git help config (directs you to the manual page, even offline!),
git clone address (Every version of every file for the history of the 
project is pulled down by default when you run git clone),
Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot: they can be unmodified, 
modified, or staged. Untracked files are any file in our working directory that 
was not in your last snapshot and is not in your staging area.
